This model creates a series of agents from location data extracted from an <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/python/agent-framework/part9/data.html">online source</a>. These agents then move around an environment, interacting with it by eating it.

This is then shown as an animation of the agents interacting with the space.<p>
